The Steve software is used for generating image mosaics and
determining how your sample is laid out on a coverslip.

The "settings_default.xml" is used to define the setup
(which objectives are available, camera orientations).

"File" -> "Save Positions" will create a list of positions
that you can use with the Dave program.

The scroll wheel on the mouse can be used to zoom in or out
of either the Mosaic or Sections view.

Right clicking on the Mosaic window or the Sections window
will bring up a menu of options. In addition there are a
number of "secret" keys:

 Mosaic tab in front:
  1. After clicking in the view area:
    <space> - Take a picture at the current mouse position.
